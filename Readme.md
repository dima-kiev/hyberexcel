OpenSource (not fully finished unfortunately)

java HyperExcel library

this is Hibernate-style wrapper for Apache POI library

it provides very convenient way to handle Excel files. 

Just create entity, 
annotate fields to map them to columns
create Reader or Writer 
and voila! 
you have your data read 
or you can create report like a pro in minutes. 
tip: you can use manually created template to be fill with data in this way. 

ENJOY!

but how:
* check tests. 
* I`ve used "DOCUMENT VIA TESTS" approach here
* Just clone the repo and run 

mvn clean install 

Or it will be more spectacular to run tests in IDEA. 

Check the Excel files in test/resources folder 

to find needed case like data type or formula, etc. 

then run test and find the one 

which is exactly the example for your desired case
